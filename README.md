# Enhanced Collatz Voxel Terrain

An interactive 3D voxel world generated from the Collatz sequence, powered by Three.js and procedural noise. Explore infinite mathematical landscapes, hunt for hidden treasures, and uncover special “discoveries” as you traverse terrain shaped by one of mathematics’ most curious sequences.

## 🌐 Overview

This project transforms the Collatz sequence into a richly textured 3D voxel terrain. Each voxel’s height and material are influenced by both multi-octave simplex noise and the values from a user-specified Collatz sequence “seed.” Enhanced UI overlays, a minimap, and interactive features (treasures, discoveries, waypoints) turn mathematical exploration into a playful experience.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern browser with WebGL support (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).  
- No build tools required—just open the HTML file or serve via a simple HTTP server.

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository** (or download the HTML file directly):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/collatz-voxel-terrain.git
   cd collatz-voxel-terrain
````

2. **(Optional)** If you’d like to host locally with live-reload:

   ```bash
   # Using Node.jsʼs http-server
   npm install -g http-server
   http-server . -c-1
   ```

### Running Locally

* **Directly**:
  Simply open `index.html` in your browser.

* **Via HTTP server** (recommended for consistent behavior):

  ```bash
  http-server . -c-1
  # Then navigate to http://localhost:8080
  ```

## ⚙️ Configuration & Customization

All key parameters live in the `<script>` section of `index.html`:

```js
const CONFIG = {
  WORLD: {
    DEFAULT_SIZE: 64,
    MAX_HEIGHT: 50,
    INSTANCING_THRESHOLD: 50,
  },
  PLAYER: {
    BASE_SPEED: 100,
    RUN_MULTIPLIER: 2,
    JUMP_POWER: 12,
    MOUSE_SENSITIVITY: 0.003,
  },
  RENDERING: {
    FOV: 75,
    NEAR: 0.1,
    FAR: 1000,
  },
  MATERIALS: {
    ENABLE_TEXTURES: true,
    ENABLE_NORMAL_MAPS: true,
  }
};
```

* **Texture Packs**: Modify or add new packs in the `TEXTURE_PACKS` object.
* **Procedural Patterns**: Tweak functions like `addStonePattern` or `addGrassPattern`.
* **Collatz Modulation**: Control how much the sequence influences terrain in `generateHeightMap()`.

Everything lives in a single HTML file for ease of distribution; you can split CSS/JS into separate files if preferred.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Collatz Sequence**

   * `getCollatzSequence(seed)` builds the sequence and tracks its maximum value.

2. **Terrain Generation**

   * Two `SimplexNoise` instances provide base height variation.
   * The sequence is sampled modulo its max to modulate elevation.
   * Heights are normalized, then mapped to `[0,1]`.

3. **Voxel Mesh Creation**

   * Heights ⇒ integer block stacks per `(x,z)` column.
   * Blocks grouped by material type; large groups use `InstancedMesh`.
   * Shared `BoxGeometry` and per-material `MeshStandardMaterial` with canvas textures.

4. **Interactive Features**

   * UI overlays updated each frame in `gameLoop()`.
   * Minimap rendered to a `<canvas>` with treasures, waypoints, and player marker.

---

## 🔭 Future Improvements

* ✨ Add day/night cycle with dynamic lighting.
* 🗺️ Export/import custom Collatz seeds or terrain snapshots.
* ⛏️ Support custom block shapes or biomes.
* 🤖 Automated testing for generation correctness and performance benchmarks.
